Next Word Prediction with LSTM
This project implements a simple next word prediction model using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model is deployed as a web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input a sequence of words and predict the next word in the sequence.

Features
LSTM Model: The model is trained to predict the next word in a given sequence of text.
Streamlit Interface: A user-friendly web interface to input text and view predictions.
Tokenization and Padding: The input text is tokenized and padded to match the model's expected input shape.
